## Importance: 
Credit card fraud is a prevalent and costly issue for both financial institutions and cardholders. Detecting and preventing fraudulent transactions is essential to protect customers, reduce financial losses, and maintain trust in the payment system.

## Data-Driven Approach: 
Credit card fraud detection relies heavily on data analysis. It involves collecting and analyzing transaction data, user behavior, and historical patterns to identify anomalies or unusual activities.

## Machine Learning: 
Many credit card fraud detection systems utilize machine learning algorithms to detect fraud.
I have used the following model implementation to solve this problem
1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Naive Bias
4. Random Forest Classifier
These algorithms can learn from historical data to recognize patterns of fraudulent behavior, allowing for real-time or near-real-time detection.

Overall, credit card fraud detection is a dynamic and ever-evolving field that plays a critical role in maintaining the security and trust of the global payment system.
